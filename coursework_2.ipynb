    "**Submission format:**  \n",
    "You should submit just one file which should either be a Jupyter notebook, or a Jupyter notebook that has been zipped up with any files that it loads (e.g. images). Note that when marking your work, we will *only* look at the contents of the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due date:**  \n",
    "Your notebook should be submitted on Study Direct before 4pm on Thursday 15th January, 2018. The standard late penalties will apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return date:**  \n",
    "Marks and feedback will be provided on Sussex Direct on Friday February 5th for all submissions that are submitted by the due date.\n",

    "**Weighting:**  \n",
    "This assessment contributes 50% of the mark for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word limit:**  \n",
    "Your Jupyter notebook should contain no more than 3000 words. The standard penalties apply for deviations from this limit (see below). You *must* specify the number of words in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failure to observe limits of length\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is taken from the Examination and Assessment Regulations Handbook \n",
    "\n",
    ">The maximum length for each assessment is publicised to students. The limits as stated include quotations in the text, but do not include the bibliography, footnotes/endnotes, appendices, abstracts, maps, illustrations, transcriptions of linguistic data, or tabulations of numerical or linguistic data and their captions. Any excess in length should not confer an advantage over other students who have adhered to the guidance. Students are requested to state the word count on submission. Where a student has marginally (within 10%) exceeded the word length the Marker should penalise the work where the student would gain an unfair advantage by exceeding the word limit. In excessive cases (>10%) the Marker need only consider work up to the designated word count, and discount any excessive word length beyond that to ensure equity across the cohort. Where an assessment is submitted and falls significantly short (>10%) of the word length, the Marker must consider in assigning a mark, if the argument has been sufficiently developed and is sufficiently supported and not assign the full marks allocation where this is not the case.\n",

    "Note that code and the content of cell outputs and examples of data are excluded from the word count.\n",

    "- Your analysis should be broken down by the type of named entity. \n",

    "- You should discuss the result of measuring the cosine similarity of the aggregated male an female feature sets. The reason to consider different sets of novels is to look at differences in gender-based cosine similarity in the different collections.\n",
    "- In Section 3 you should have considered a number of alternative ways of deriving feature sets for characters. In this section, you should present the results of using these alternative approaches.\n",
    "- You should explain what you have done to assess the cosine similarity of pairs of features sets that are aggregated over randomly selected characters (i.e. characters that aren't split up on the basis of gender). This should provide an indication as to whether the differences you find when making a gender-based comparison are meaningful.\n",
